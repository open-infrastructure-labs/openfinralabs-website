        We are focused on delivering open source tools to build and run cloud, container, AI, big data and edge workloads efficiently, repeatedly and predictably. Our projects embrace three themes:

        *Operate First* - helping developers gain insights into operational considerations and ensure their projects will integrate and operate well in production environments.
        
        *Low-Code Development* - enabling developers to build production-grade AI and big data applications without specialized skills and with a minimal level of coding.

        *Optimized Infrastructure* - delivering infrastructure innovations to improve the performance of emerging workloads without burdening application developers.

        This is a quote from one of the project's users. Ideally, we will have
        something like this, with substance, to validate the claim that this
        brand name uses and likes the project if we don't have a logo

    What's the quickest way to give a project the perception of credibility?
    Tell the reader that people (or organizations) they know are already using
    it. The most effective way to do that is with logos, but if logos aren't
    available we can use text.
