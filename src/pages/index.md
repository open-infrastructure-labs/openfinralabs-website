        This is a quote from one of the project's users. Ideally, we will have
        something like this, with substance, to validate the claim that this
        brand name uses and likes the project if we don't have a logo

    What's the quickest way to give a project the perception of credibility?
    Tell the reader that people (or organizations) they know are already using
    it. The most effective way to do that is with logos, but if logos aren't
    available we can use text.
