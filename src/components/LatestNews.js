This effort is creating a production research cloud that serves as the first, founding region in the OpenInfra Labs Cloud Network, which is envisioned to be a network of production clouds connecting open source projects to production. OpenInfra Labs will enable the cloud services and network deployed in this founding region to be replicated to other regions, federated between these regions and extended beyond academia.</h4>
